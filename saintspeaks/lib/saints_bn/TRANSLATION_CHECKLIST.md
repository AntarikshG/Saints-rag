## Translation Quality Standards

### Required Checks
- ✓ Meaning preserved from original
- ✓ Natural Bengali flow and grammar
- ✓ Proper use of Bengali diacritics
- ✓ Consistent terminology throughout
- ✓ Appropriate honorifics used
- ✓ No spelling or typographical errors
- ✓ Formatted correctly for app display
- ✓ Test on actual devices (Android/iOS)

### Special Considerations for Bengali
1. **Script Complexity**: Ensure all conjunct characters (যুক্তাক্ষর) render correctly
2. **Diacritics**: Proper use of vowel diacritics (মাত্রা)
3. **Regional Variants**: Use standard Bengali, avoiding excessive colloquialisms
4. **Sanskrit Terms**: Balance between Bengali and Sanskrit terminology
5. **Length**: Bengali text may be longer/shorter than English - test UI layouts
