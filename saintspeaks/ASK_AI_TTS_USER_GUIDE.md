- **Default (100%)**: Neutral and clear
- **Higher Pitch (120-150%)**: More energetic delivery

### Tip 5: Settings Persist
Your language, voice, speed, and pitch settings are saved automatically. They'll be remembered next time you use the app!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No sound when playing
**Solution**: Check device volume and ensure TTS is initialized (wait a moment after page loads)

### Issue: Language not available
**Solution**: Some languages may not be available on all devices. Try downloading TTS voices from your device's language settings.

### Issue: Voice sounds robotic
**Solution**: Try selecting a different voice from the Voice dropdown. Higher-quality voices may need to be downloaded.

### Issue: TTS stops unexpectedly
**Solution**: Press the Stop button, then Play again. Check that your internet connection is stable for streaming answers.

### Issue: Can't change voice
**Solution**: Not all languages have multiple voices. If no Voice dropdown appears, only one voice is available for that language.
